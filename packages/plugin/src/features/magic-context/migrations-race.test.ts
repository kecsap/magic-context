/**
 * Multi-instance migration race tolerance.
 *
 * Two plugin processes starting concurrently against the shared
 * `~/.local/share/cortexkit/magic-context/context.db` can both observe
 * `MAX(version) = N` before either commits. The first commits v(N+1);
 * the second's transaction body runs `migration.up()` (now a no-op since
 * the schema change has already landed), then hits PRIMARY KEY conflict
 * on the `INSERT INTO schema_migrations` row.
 *
 * The race tolerance fix detects that specific conflict shape and
 * resumes from the next pending migration instead of fail-closing the
 * plugin. Any other migration failure (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, data
 * heal) still fail-closes per the existing contract.
